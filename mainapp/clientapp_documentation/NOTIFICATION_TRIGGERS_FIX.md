# Notification Triggers - Missing Automatic Notifications Fix ✅

## 🐛 Problem

Notifications were not being created automatically when package or shipment statuses changed via direct database updates from the frontend.

## 🔍 Root Cause

### **The Issue:**

The frontend performs **direct database updates** when changing package status:

```typescript
// From package intake page (approveShipment function)
await supabase
  .from('packages')
  .update({ 
    status: 'processing',
    updated_at: new Date().toISOString() 
  })
  .eq('id', packageId);
```

**Problem:** These direct updates bypass the `update_package_status()` function in `/sql/04_package_functions.sql`, which is responsible for creating notifications.

### **What Was Missing:**

There was **NO TRIGGER** on the `packages` or `shipments` tables to automatically create notifications when the status column changed.

**Result:** Users never received notifications when their packages/shipments were updated unless the specific PL/pgSQL function was called (which the frontend doesn't do).

---

## ✅ Solution

Created **database triggers** that automatically create notifications whenever package or shipment status changes, regardless of how the update occurs.

### **Files Created:**

1. **`/sql/90_package_status_notification_trigger.sql`**
   - Trigger function: `notify_package_status_change()`
   - Trigger: `trigger_notify_package_status_change`
   - Fires on: `AFTER UPDATE OF status ON packages`

2. **`/sql/91_shipment_status_notification_trigger.sql`**
   - Trigger function: `notify_shipment_status_change()`
   - Trigger: `trigger_notify_shipment_status_change`
   - Fires on: `AFTER UPDATE OF status ON shipments`

---

## 📋 How It Works

### **Package Status Notification Trigger**

```sql
-- Automatically creates notification when package status changes
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_notify_package_status_change
    AFTER UPDATE OF status ON packages
    FOR EACH ROW
    WHEN (OLD.status IS DISTINCT FROM NEW.status)
    EXECUTE FUNCTION notify_package_status_change();
```

**Trigger Logic:**
1. Detects when `packages.status` column changes
2. Maps status to user-friendly message:
   - `pending` → "is pending receipt at our warehouse"
   - `received` → "has been received at our warehouse"
   - `processing` → "is being processed"
   - `shipped` → "has been shipped and is on its way"
   - `delivered` → "has been delivered successfully"
3. Creates notification with:
   - Type: `'package_update'`
   - Title: `'Package Status Update'`
   - Message: Includes tracking number or description
4. Inserts into `notifications` table automatically

### **Shipment Status Notification Trigger**

```sql
-- Automatically creates notification when shipment status changes
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_notify_shipment_status_change
    AFTER UPDATE OF status ON shipments
    FOR EACH ROW
    WHEN (OLD.status IS DISTINCT FROM NEW.status)
    EXECUTE FUNCTION notify_shipment_status_change();
```

**Trigger Logic:**
1. Detects when `shipments.status` column changes
2. Maps status to user-friendly message:
   - `pending` → "is being prepared"
   - `in_transit` → "is now in transit"
   - `shipped` → "has been shipped and is on its way"
   - `out_for_delivery` → "is out for delivery"
   - `delivered` → "has been delivered successfully"
   - `delayed` → "has been delayed - we apologize for the inconvenience"
3. Creates notification with:
   - Type: `'shipment_update'`
   - Title: `'Shipment Status Update'`
   - Message: Includes recipient name and tracking number
4. Inserts into `notifications` table automatically

## 🚀 Installation

### **Step 1: Run Package Trigger SQL**

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
-- /sql/90_package_status_notification_trigger.sql
```

This creates the trigger for package status changes.

### **Step 2: Run Shipment Trigger SQL**

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
-- /sql/91_shipment_status_notification_trigger.sql
```

This creates the trigger for shipment status changes.

### **Step 3: Verify Triggers Were Created**

```sql
-- Check package trigger
SELECT trigger_name, event_manipulation, event_object_table
FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE trigger_name = 'trigger_notify_package_status_change';

-- Check shipment trigger
SELECT trigger_name, event_manipulation, event_object_table
FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE trigger_name = 'trigger_notify_shipment_status_change';
```

Expected output: Both triggers should appear in the results.

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test Package Notifications**

```sql
-- 1. Find a package
SELECT id, user_id, status, tracking_number 
FROM packages 
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID' 
LIMIT 1;

-- 2. Update package status (simulates frontend action)
UPDATE packages 
SET status = 'processing' 
WHERE id = 'PACKAGE_ID_FROM_STEP_1';

-- 3. Check if notification was created
SELECT * 
FROM notifications 
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ New notification with type `'package_update'`
- ✅ Message like: "Your package (TRK123) is being processed."
- ✅ `is_read = false`
- ✅ `created_at` matches current time

### **Test Shipment Notifications**

```sql
-- 1. Find a shipment
SELECT id, user_id, status, tracking_number 
FROM shipments 
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID' 
LIMIT 1;

-- 2. Update shipment status
UPDATE shipments 
SET status = 'in_transit' 
WHERE id = 'SHIPMENT_ID_FROM_STEP_1';

-- 3. Check if notification was created
SELECT * 
FROM notifications 
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ New notification with type `'shipment_update'`
- ✅ Message like: "Your shipment to John Doe (TRK456) is now in transit."
- ✅ `is_read = false`
- ✅ `created_at` matches current time

### **Test Frontend Action**

1. Login to the app
2. Go to Package Intake page
3. Click "Process" button on a package
4. **Check:**
   - ✅ Toast notification appears immediately
   - ✅ Notification shows in notifications page
   - ✅ Database has new notification record

## 📊 Benefits

### **Before (Without Triggers):**
```
Frontend Update → Direct DB Update → ❌ No Notification Created
User: "Why didn't I get notified?"
```

### **After (With Triggers):**
```
Frontend Update → Direct DB Update → ✅ Trigger Fires → ✅ Notification Created → ✅ Toast Appears
User: Gets instant notification! 🎉
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Trigger Behavior:**

**When Triggers Fire:**
- ✅ Frontend direct updates: `supabase.from('packages').update()`
- ✅ Admin function calls: `update_package_status()`
- ✅ Manual SQL updates: `UPDATE packages SET status = ...`
- ✅ Batch updates
- ✅ Any status change from any source

**When Triggers DON'T Fire:**
- ❌ Updates to other columns (only `status` column changes trigger it)
- ❌ No change in status value (same status update)
- ❌ INSERT or DELETE operations (only UPDATE)

### **Performance:**

- **Efficient:** Triggers only fire when status column changes
- **Conditional:** `WHEN (OLD.status IS DISTINCT FROM NEW.status)`
- **No overhead:** Only runs necessary code
- **Single notification:** One trigger execution per status change

### **Security:**

- **SECURITY DEFINER:** Trigger runs with function owner permissions
- **Permissions granted:** To `postgres`, `authenticated`, `service_role`
- **RLS respected:** Notifications created respect Row Level Security
- **Audit trail:** Uses database logging with `RAISE NOTICE`

## 📝 Example Notification Flow

### **Scenario: User's Package is Processed**

1. **Frontend Action:**
   ```typescript
   await supabase
     .from('packages')
     .update({ status: 'processing' })
     .eq('id', packageId);
   ```

2. **Database Trigger:**
   ```
   packages table updated → status changed from 'received' to 'processing'
   → trigger_notify_package_status_change fires
   → notify_package_status_change() executes
   ```

3. **Notification Created:**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO notifications (
     user_id,
     title,
     message,
     type,
     is_read
   ) VALUES (
     'user_id_here',
     'Package Status Update',
     'Your package (TRK12345) is being processed.',
     'package_update',
     false
   );
   ```

4. **Frontend Receives:**
   ```
   Supabase Realtime → useNotificationRealtime hook
   → handleNewNotification callback
   → Toast notification appears
   → Notifications page updates
   ```

**Total Time:** < 1 second from status update to toast notification! ⚡
