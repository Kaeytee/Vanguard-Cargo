  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \

### **View Support Messages in Database**
```sql
-- Check recent support messages
SELECT * FROM support_messages ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check email delivery status
SELECT email_sent, COUNT(*) FROM support_messages GROUP BY email_sent;
```

### **Monitor Function Logs**
```bash
# View recent logs
supabase functions logs send-support-email --limit 20

# Follow logs in real-time
supabase functions logs send-support-email --follow
```

## **ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting**

### **If emails aren't sending:**
1. Check API key is correct: `supabase secrets list`
2. Verify Resend account is active
3. Check spam/junk folder
4. View function logs: `supabase functions logs send-support-email`

### **If function deployment fails:**
1. Make sure you're in the project directory
2. Check you're logged in: `supabase status`
3. Re-link project: `supabase link --project-ref rsxxjcsmcrcxdmyuytzc`

### **If form submission fails:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify database table exists: `SELECT * FROM support_messages LIMIT 1;`
3. Check function is deployed: `supabase functions list`
