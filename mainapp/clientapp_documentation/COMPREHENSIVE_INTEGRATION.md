# Comprehensive Warehouse Integration Documentation

This document describes the comprehensive integration layer implemented between the Vanguard Cargo client app and warehouse system.

## Overview

The integration provides a unified interface for:
- âœ… Status mapping between warehouse and client systems
- âœ… Country validation and international shipping rules  
- âœ… Cross-border coordination and customs handling
- âœ… Package lifecycle management with analytics
- âœ… Real-time tracking and notifications
- âœ… Client dashboard and reporting
- âœ… React hooks for UI components

## Core Services

### 1. Status Mapping Service (`statusMapping.ts`)
Maps warehouse statuses to client-friendly statuses with transitions, phases, and display info.

**Key Methods:**
- `warehouseToClient(status)` - Convert warehouse status to client status
- `getStatusIcon(status)` - Get icon for status display
- `getPhase(status)` - Get current phase (submission, processing, shipping, delivery)

### 2. Country Validation Service (`countryValidation.ts`)
Handles international shipping validation, routes, costs, and restrictions.

**Key Methods:**
- `getCountryInfo(countryCode)` - Get country information and restrictions
- `calculateShippingCost(origin, dest, service, weight, type)` - Calculate shipping costs
- `validateShippingRoute(origin, dest)` - Validate if route is supported

### 3. Cross-Border Service (`crossBorderService.ts`)
Manages international handoffs, customs, and warehouse coordination.

**Key Methods:**
- `initiateHandoff(packageId)` - Start cross-border process
- `trackInternationalShipment(trackingNumber)` - Track international packages
- `getClearanceStatus(packageId)` - Get customs clearance status

### 4. Package Lifecycle Service (`packageLifecycle.ts`)
Complete package management from creation to delivery with analytics.

**Key Methods:**
- `getPackageLifecycle(packageId)` - Get full package history
- `updatePackageStatus(packageId, status, reason, user)` - Update package status
- `getPackageAnalytics(packageId)` - Get package metrics and analytics

### 5. Comprehensive Integration Service (`comprehensiveIntegration.ts`)
Main integration layer that combines all services into unified methods.

**Key Methods:**
- `getUnifiedPackageInfo(packageId)` - Get complete package info for client
- `trackPackage(trackingNumber)` - Track package with real-time updates
- `getClientDashboard(clientId)` - Get client dashboard with summary data

## React Hooks

The integration includes React hooks for easy UI integration:

### `usePackageTracking(packageId)`
Tracks a single package with real-time updates.

```tsx
const { packageInfo, loading, error, trackPackage, reportIssue } = usePackageTracking('PKG-123');
```

### `useClientDashboard(clientId)`
Provides client dashboard data with auto-refresh.

```tsx
const { dashboard, loading, error, refreshDashboard } = useClientDashboard('client-123');
```

### `useShippingValidation()`
Validates shipping routes and calculates costs.

```tsx
const { validateRoute, calculateCost, loading } = useShippingValidation();
```

### `useRealTimeTracking()`
Connects to real-time package updates.

```tsx
const { updates, isConnected, connect, disconnect } = useRealTimeTracking();
```

## UI Components

### Enhanced Tracking Component
Updated to use comprehensive integration hooks for rich tracking displays.

**Usage:**
```tsx
<EnhancedTracking 
  packageId="PKG-123" 
  onStatusChange={(status) => console.log(status)} 
/>
```

### Comprehensive Dashboard Component  
New dashboard component showing package summaries, notifications, and quick actions.

**Usage:**
```tsx
<ComprehensiveDashboard clientId="client-123" />
```

## Integration Features

### Status Mapping
- âœ… Complete mapping between warehouse and client statuses
- âœ… Status transitions with validation
- âœ… Phase-based organization (submission â†’ processing â†’ shipping â†’ delivery)
- âœ… Color and icon assignments for UI display

### International Shipping
- âœ… Country validation and restrictions
- âœ… Supported routes and services
- âœ… Real-time cost calculation with breakdown
- âœ… Cross-border handoff coordination

### Package Lifecycle
- âœ… Complete status history tracking
- âœ… Exception handling and reporting
- âœ… Analytics and metrics
- âœ… Cost tracking and billing integration

### Real-time Updates
- âœ… Live tracking updates
- âœ… Notification system
- âœ… Exception alerts
- âœ… Status change notifications

## Development Notes

### Testing
Use the integration verification script to test all services:

```typescript
import IntegrationVerification from './test/integrationVerification';
await IntegrationVerification.runFullVerification();
```

### Mock Data
All services include mock data fallbacks for development and testing.

### Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling with fallbacks to prevent UI breakage.

### TypeScript
Fully typed interfaces for all data structures and method signatures.

## Business Logic Alignment

The integration follows Vanguard Cargo business rules:

1. **International Only**: Enforces international shipping requirement
2. **Warehouse-to-Warehouse**: Models foreign warehouse â†’ local warehouse flow  
3. **Customer Pickup**: Supports warehouse pickup model for delivery
4. **Status Mapping**: Maintains warehouse operational status while showing client-friendly status
5. **Cost Structure**: Implements actual shipping cost calculation with service fees
6. **Cross-border Compliance**: Handles customs and international regulations

## Next Steps

The integration is now complete and ready for:

1. âœ… UI component integration (dashboard, tracking, history)
2. âœ… End-to-end testing with mock data
3. âœ… Production deployment preparation
4. ðŸ”„ Real API integration (replace mock data)
5. ðŸ”„ Performance optimization
6. ðŸ”„ Advanced analytics features
