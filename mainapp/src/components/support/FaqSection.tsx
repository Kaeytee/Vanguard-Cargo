      question: "How do I get my free US address?",
      answer:
        "Register for an account on our platform and you'll receive a unique US shipping address within minutes. Use this address when shopping at any US retailer, and we'll receive your packages at our warehouse.",

      question: "How does package consolidation work?",

        "Our customers typically save 40-70% on shipping costs through consolidation and our bulk shipping rates. The exact savings depend on the number and size of your packages.",
    },
    {
      question: "What items can I ship from the US to Ghana?",
      answer:
        "You can ship most items including electronics, clothing, books, and personal items. We cannot ship prohibited items such as hazardous materials, perishables, liquids over 100ml, or items restricted by Ghana Customs.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does shipping take to Ghana?",
      answer:
        "Standard shipping takes 7-14 business days from our US warehouse to Ghana. We also offer express shipping options for 3-7 business days delivery.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I track my packages?",
      answer:
        "You can track your packages in real-time through your dashboard. We provide updates from when your package arrives at our US warehouse until it's delivered to your address in Ghana.",
