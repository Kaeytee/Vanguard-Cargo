- **Message:** Structured format with all requester details

### 3. Backend Processing
**Infrastructure:** Supabase Edge Function + Resend Email Service

**Flow:**
```
User Submits Form
    ‚Üì
SupportService.submitSupportMessage()
    ‚Üì
Supabase Edge Function (resend-email)
    ‚Üì
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Database Insert (support_messages table)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Email Sending (Resend Service)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Admin Notification Email
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Customer Confirmation Email
```

**Database Table:** `support_messages`
- Stores all deletion requests with full metadata
- Status tracking: `new` ‚Üí `in_progress` ‚Üí `resolved` ‚Üí `closed`
- Category: `complaint` (for priority handling)
- Email delivery tracking and error logging

### 4. Routing
**File:** `/src/App.tsx`

    </>
  }
/>
```

**URL:** `https://www.vanguardcargo.co/data-deletion`

## üìà Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track

**Request Volume:**
- Number of deletion requests per day/week/month
- Trends in deletion reasons
- Time to process requests
- Success/failure rates

**Admin Dashboard (Future Enhancement):**
```typescript
interface DeletionRequestMetrics {
  totalRequests: number;
  pendingRequests: number;
  processedRequests: number;
  averageProcessingTime: number; // in days
  topReasons: Array<{ reason: string; count: number }>;
  monthlyTrend: Array<{ month: string; count: number }>;
}
```

### Database Queries for Monitoring

**Get Pending Deletion Requests:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM support_messages
WHERE subject LIKE 'DATA DELETION REQUEST%'
  AND status IN ('new', 'in_progress')
ORDER BY created_at ASC;
```

**Get Deletion Request Statistics:**
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_requests,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'new') as pending,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'resolved') as completed,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (responded_at - created_at)) / 86400) as avg_days
FROM support_messages
WHERE subject LIKE 'DATA DELETION REQUEST%';
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
No additional environment variables required. Uses existing support email configuration:

```env
# Existing Supabase configuration (already set up)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://rsxxjcsmcrcxdmyuytzc.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[your-anon-key]

# Resend API configuration (already set up in Edge Function)
RESEND_API_KEY=[your-resend-api-key]
ADMIN_EMAIL=support@vanguardcargo.co
```

### Edge Function Configuration
**File:** `supabase/functions/resend-email/index.ts`

Already configured to handle support messages. Data deletion requests are automatically processed through this existing function with category `'complaint'`.
